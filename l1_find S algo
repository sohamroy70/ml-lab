# # Find-S Algorithm:
# ## Algorithm:
# 1. Initialize h to the most specific hypothesis in H
# 2. For each positive training instance x
#         i. For each attribute constraint a i in h :
#             a. If the constraint a i in h is satisfied by x Then do nothing
#             b. Else replace a i in h by the next more general constraint that is satisfied by x
# 3. Output hypothesis h
#

import csv
# ### Read File:
# Load the csv file and asign each row to a data frame
# Also print the row to see the dataset (optional)

# In[ ]:

    reader = csv.reader(csfile)

# 1. The most general hypothesis is represented by:
#     ```['?', '?', '?', '?', '?', '?']```
# 2. The most specific hypothesis is represented by:
#     ```['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']```

# In[ ]:


print("The most general hypothesis:",["?"]*num_attributes)
print("The most specific hypothesis:",["0"]*num_attributes)


# ### Algorithm Implementation:
# Implementation of the above algorithm by updaing the hypothesis at each iteration and output the final hypothesis.
